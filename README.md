### Common issues:

- **Stencil CLI** We're working to bring full support to integrate buyer portal into [stencil-cli](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/storefront/stencil). If you find any issues feel free to open an issue report.
- **Cross-Origin Issues:** If you encounter cross-origin issues, ensure you have the correct URLs in your `.env` file and verify that your store's origin URL is allowed. You can use a tunnel service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server to the internet.
- **Environment Variables:** Ensure you have the correct environment variables set in your `.env` file. These variables are used to configure your application for different environments.
- **Header and Footer Scripts:** Ensure you have the correct header and footer scripts set in your BigCommerce store. These scripts are used to load your application into the storefront.
- **Build Errors:** If you encounter build errors, ensure you have the correct dependencies installed and that your project is set up correctly. You can run `yarn prepare` to ensure all dependencies are installed and up to date.
